## Welcome to Moltz

Moltz is a **native desktop AI chat application** that brings the familiar ChatGPT/Claude.ai experience to your computer—but faster, more private, and actually built for desktop use.

Think of it as your AI assistant that lives on your machine, not in a browser tab. Built with Tauri, React, and Rust.

**Why Moltz?**
- **⚡ Native Speed** — Real desktop app, not a glorified browser wrapper
- **🔒 Your Data** — Conversations encrypted and stored locally on your device
- **🎯 Any Model** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, or local models via Clawdbot Gateway
- **⌨️ Global Hotkey** — Hit a key combo, Moltz appears instantly
- **✈️ Offline Mode** — Read and search past conversations without internet
- **😌 Familiar UX** — Same chat experience you already know
